# Deep Reasoning Networks (DRNets)

This repo contains the working code for the [Deep Reasoning Networks](https://github.com/PiGrieco/DRNets-Nature-Machine-Intelligence) repository. The repo is divided into two parts:

- **Crystal-Structure-Phase-Mapping**
- **Games**

The **Games** directory is further sub-divided into:

- **MNIST_Sudoku_4x4**
- **MNIST_Sudoku_9x9**

This repository executes the code in **Kaggle Notebook** with **GPU** enabled. The [Games](https://github.com/MUmairAk/DRNets/tree/master/Games) directory contains the two notebooks for **MNIST_Sudoku_4x4** and **MNIST_Sudoku_9x9**.
